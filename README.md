# Introduction to Matplotlib

In this repository we will be introduced to a common Python visualization package, Matplotlib. It was conceived by John Hunter in 2002 to emulate Matlab style plotting. It is the base tool that many other visualization packages are built upon, so it is valuable to get a good understanding of how to work with it for building plots.


## Objective
As a Data Analyst it is necessary to turn numeric and non-numeric data into easy to understand visualizations, being able to do this directly in Python allows for the use of open source tools to quickly create charts from data in a programmatic way. These notebooks will help you learn how to do this using Matplotlib (and Seaborn)

## Task 

Open the repository in VSCode and create a new environment from the environment yml file:  
```conda env create -f environment.yml```  

Please work through the [Basic Plotting with Matplotlib Notebook](Basic_plotting_with_matplotlib.ipynb). This Notebook will give you an overview of some basic plotting options needed for an EDA in Python.

There are more Notebooks on advanced plotting options in the [Notebook-folder](notebooks). You can work through these notebooks as Extra Credit during free time.
